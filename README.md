A personal progressive, interactive portfolio of Consolata Njeri

#  Consolata Njeri's Github Protfolio  #

# Description #

This project protrays the creation of my web development protfolio, it is a live site that currently has a home page, consisting of an about me, work, contact me and resume navigation bar. Along side the home page there are sub pages that break down the navigation bar section, the work section contains a brief description of myself, my education background, my hobbies and interests, as well as my occupation. 

The photos protrayed on the sub pages are of my self and screenshots of my deployed projects/HW in the world of coding. I hope to use this website to consolidate my work and interest to the public audience as well as any hiring managers who wish to hire me for my skills in coding.
